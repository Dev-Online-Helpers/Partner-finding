# Partner-finding

This is the place for you to find partners to do projecs with in the future.

## The why:
Working with another person (or more as a team) is a great skill that any developer should have.<br>
Working alone is not bad but with a team you can create bigger, more impressive projects and learn a lot.


## How to participate: 

- Create a branch from the main branch (for example tamir_oren for tamir and oren team)/fork the repository.

- Pick one of the given projects (every folder is a project), start work on it with your partner.

- Once done working on your project you can create pr to recive code review.


## Looking at the future:

**Liked working with your partner?** <br>
Greate - you have found a partner for your next projects.

**Want to search for different partner?** <br>
All you need to do is repet the procces again with different team, you can change your project so you wont get board repeting yourself.

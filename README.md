# Partner-finding

This is the place for you to find partners to do projecs with in the future.

## The why:
Working with another person (or more as a team) is a great skill that any developer should have.<br>
Working alone is not bad but with a team you can create bigger, more impressive projects and learn a lot.


## How to participate: 

- Create a branch from the main branch (for example tamir_oren for tamir and oren team)/fork the repository.

- After you finished working on your project you can create pr to recive code review.
